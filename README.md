## Overview

- **Total Transaction Volume**: `422,660`  
- **Policy A Transactions**: `417,052`  
- **Policy B Transactions**: `5,608`  

These high-level KPIs quickly indicate the overall scale of transactions processed, as well as how many are governed by each policy.

## Visuals and Insights

1. **Count of Policy by Month**  
   - Shows how transaction counts fluctuate over time.  
   - Identifies potential seasonal trends or spikes in policy-specific transactions.

2. **Risk Rating Distribution**  
   - Pie chart illustrating overall proportions of *high*, *medium*, and *low* risk.  
   - Provides an at-a-glance view of the risk makeup across all transactions.

3. **Risk Rating by Merchant Country Code**  
   - Bar chart breaking down transactions by **Merchant Country Code** on the X-axis and **Count of Risk Rating** on the Y-axis.  
   - Quick way to see which countries have the most *high*, *medium*, or *low* risk transactions.

4. **Transaction Volume Over Time**  
   - Line chart depicting the trend of transactions from January to May 2021 (example time window).  
   - Helps pinpoint any unusual spikes or drops in daily/weekly transaction volume.

5. **Transaction Origin**  
   - Bar chart that categorizes transactions as **Domestic**, **Cross-Border**, or **Unknown**.  
   - Leverages the comparison of **True IP Geo** and **Merchant Country Code** to highlight cross-border activity, which can carry higher risk.

6. **Transaction with VPN**  
   - Bar or column chart that flags the presence of a VPN or proxy based on IP analysis.  
   - High VPN usage could indicate potential fraud or higher-risk transactions.

## Filters / Slicers

- **Year / Month**: Allows selecting specific time periods to analyze changes in transaction volume or risk over different ranges.  
- **Policy**: Enables comparing the performance and outcomes of multiple policies (e.g., Policy A vs. Policy B).  
- **Risk Rating**: Drills down into *high*, *medium*, or *low* risk transactions to see the associated charts update.

## Use Cases

1. **Fraud Detection**  
   - Identify countries with disproportionately high *high-risk* transactions.  
   - Detect spikes in VPN usage or cross-border transactions that might signal fraudulent behavior.

2. **Policy Effectiveness**  
   - Evaluate how each policy handles risk: Are there more rejections or approvals under Policy A vs. Policy B?  
   - Helps refine the weightings of each policy rule to reduce false positives or false negatives.

3. **Operational Insights**  
   - Track overall transaction volume trends to manage resources (e.g., support, compliance).  
   - Spot seasonal or monthly patterns that might justify changes in staffing, marketing, or promotional strategies.

## Future Enhancements

- **LexID Digital Trust Score Integration**: Show correlation between trust scores and overall risk ratings.  
- **Drill-Through to Transaction-Level Details**: Enable deeper analysis by clicking a data point to view session IDs, IP addresses, or reason codes.  
- **Real-Time Updates**: Implement refresh schedules to maintain near real-time visibility of risk trends.
